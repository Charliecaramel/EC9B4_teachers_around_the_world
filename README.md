# Who are the teachers? A cross country analysis of teacher characteristics and labour market conditions.

## Abstract
This study documents observable differences in teacher characteristics across countries at different stages of development. Using cross country population census and literacy skill assessment data, the results show that high income countries enjoy a teacher advantage. The quantity and quality of teachers improve as countries develop. This result provides an mechanism to explain the divergence in global learning outcomes. In addition, this paper shows that the the positive selectiveness of teachers fall as countries develop. The observation is largely consistent with changes in relative compensation in occupation wage premia and returns to education.
